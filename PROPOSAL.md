# Final Project Proposal
I would like to recreate the game Minesweeper 
with Cinder. 

I really enjoy playing the game
and often think about the logic behind it.
I feel that recreating the game will give me a 
better understanding of it and perhaps will help
me come up with faster strategies when playing.

For Week 1, I would try to complete game 
generation and basic logic such as tile objects.
I would also start with Cinder 
to actually generate the minefield.

For Week 2, I would try to complete player
interaction (flagging, opening squares) 
with the game and winning and losing logic.

For Week 3, I would like to complete a saveable 
scoreboard and incorporate a timer. I would also
like to be able to have the first move never occur
on a bomb. 

Stretch goals:
* Improve efficiency
* Somehow connect to web?
* Multiple modes (beginner, intermediate, expert)
* Nice user interface
